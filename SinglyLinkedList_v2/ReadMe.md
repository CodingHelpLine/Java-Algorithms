## Java Implementation of Singly Linked List 

=: Simple Data Structure

=: Dynamic memory allocation, O(n) space requirement 

=: Linear Container

=: Linear traversal to access arbitrary element

=: Efficient addition and removal O(N) Worst and Average Case. O(1) Best case. 

=: Singly Linked List only forward traversal

### Methods:

* addFront(int): add to the front of list 
* addBack(int): add to the back of list 
* size(): return number of elements in the list 
* remove(int): an element from the list
* print(): display the list 
* FindMax(): Function to find the maximum element in the List.
* FindMin(): Function to find the Minimum Element in the List.
* CalcSum(): Function to find the Sum of all elements in the List.
* CalcAverage(): Function to find the average of all elements in the List. 
* CalcSD(): Function to calculate the Standard Deviation of elements. 
* createOddList(): Create a List with odd elements
* createEvenList(): Create a List with Event Elements
* MergeLists(): Merge Two Lists List1: 1, 3, 5, List2: 2, 4, 6 Result: 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6
* SplitList(): Split the list into two at a threshold value.
  List: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
  Threshold: 4
  LeftList: 1, 2, 3, 4
  RightList: 5, 6, 7
* ZipLists(): Zip Two lists as follows: 
  list1: 1, 3, 5    list2: 2, 4, 6     
  Result: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
