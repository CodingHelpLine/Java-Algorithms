## Java Array-based Queue Implementation
A queue is an abstract data structure that is open on both ends. One end is used to 
insert or enqueue an element while the other end used to remove or dequeue the element. 
there are various techniques to implement a Queue such as Linked List based queue or an
array-based queue. Queue is a FIFO - First In Last Out data structure. 

## Example
Create Queue : Queue is Empty
Enqueue 5:
Queue is: 5
Enqueue 7: 
Queue is: 5 7
Enqueue 1: 
Queue is: 5 7 1
Dequeue: 5
Queue is: 7 1
Enqueue 8:
Queue is: 7 1 8
Enqueue 3:
Queue is: 7 1 8 3
Dequeue: 7
Queue is: 1 8 3
Dequeue: 1
Queue is: 8 3
