# Java Selection Sort Implementation and Benchmarking
---------------------------------------------------

* Selection sort is one of the in-place stable and simple sorting 
The algorithm is beneficial to be used with smaller lists and arrays. 
This is one of the slowest sorting algorithms.

* It maintains two subarrays or lists: Sorted and Unsorted. 

* To achieve sorting order as it iterates the unsorted list and finds or 
  select the minimum element from the unsorted sub-array or list and insert
  it into a sorted subarray or list. 

* The Runtime is O(N^2) in all the cases best, worst, and average. 

* The Number of swaps: Best Case O(0), Worst and Average Case O(N) as at
  minimum it requires O(N/2) swaps. 

* Space Complexity of selection sort is O(1)

* The program will test the selection sort for all three cases: Best, Worst
  and Average case. 

* FillArray Utility class is used to fill the array and do other housekeeping
  functions.
