## Java Implementation of Singly Ordered Linked List 

* Simple Data Structure. 

* Dynamic Memory Allocation. O(N) Space requirement. 

* This is a Linear Data Structure. 

* Linear Traversal to access an arbitrary element. 

* Elements are stored in Ascending Order. 

* Efficient Insert and Remove methods: Best case O(N), Worst and Average case complexity is O(N). The best case only occurs at the head of the Linked List. 


## Methods:
* addFront(int): Add element to the front of Linked List if value is smaller than the value stored at current Head Node. 

* add(int):Function places the new value at correct place and maintain the order of List. 

* size(): Function return the number of elements in the Linked List.    

* remove(int): Function removes the first occurrence of element from the Linked List. 

* print(): Display the Linked List.
