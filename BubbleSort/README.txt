# Java BubbleSort Algorithm
---------------------------------

Bubble Sort or Sinking Sort is a simple sorting algorithm.

Repeatedly Take an element of the unsorted List or Array and compare it with its adjacent element. 
Swap the elements if they are not in order. 

It uses nested loops. 
The element A[0] is compared with A[1], Element A[1] with A[2], and so on until 
the List or Array is sorted.  

Benchmarking of algorith: Record time of execution, number of swaps and Comparisons.
